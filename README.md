### Introduction

I have mostly experience with FrontEnd development. However, I have some experience in backend programming too.

I didn't use any external library (e.g. _Lodash_) for this trial because I think the target of this test was to check the logic skills.

I also believe this example doesn't really give any feedback on the skills about React / Redux, and UI in general ( being mostly a logic test ).

You must install NodeJS version 7 in order to run this program.
It supports **ES6** operators, while older versions of Node don't.

You can use the CLI or the npm scripts

Run against file
